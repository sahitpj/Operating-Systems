Equation is of the form 

avg of all response times would be 

RT = (0 + (n+t) + (2n+2t))/3
 
Some of all turnaround times would be 

TT = ((3n+3t+10-n) + (3n+3t+(10-n)+t+(20-n)) + (3n+3t+(10-n)+t+(20-n) + t + (30-n)))/3


How are we scheduling the processes?

we first run a small part of all programs so that the RT is minimized. We then run the rest of the parts without 
running in the Round Robin Fashion, thus minimizing the TT

If we change the first job to come after 10sec then, 


Then we follow the above instruction for the first two processes. As soon as the third process arives
we give it the CPU, thus minimizing RT, however only for a time period of n after which we finish the other 2 processes
and then come back to the third.
